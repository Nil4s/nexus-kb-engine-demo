# Nexus KB Engine - Technical Demonstration

This repository contains the technical demonstration and runnable proof-of-concept for the Nexus KB Engine, a new, capital-efficient architecture for high-performance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Key Innovations

The engine achieves a new paradigm in retrieval performance through a synthesis of three core, principled technologies:

1.  **Memory-Mapped I/O:** Provides zero-copy, on-disk performance that rivals in-memory speed.
2.  **Vectorized Scoring:** Executes search logic at the speed of compiled C code using NumPy.
3.  **Principled Compression:** Utilizes information-density pruning and efficient storage formats to maintain a minimal footprint.

## Live Demonstration

A complete technical overview, including benchmark results and the runnable proof-of-concept, is available on our live demo page.

## The Broader Vision

The Nexus KB engine is the foundational knowledge layer of a complete, production-ready Cognitive Architecture. This architecture features a unified orchestrator that has demonstrated perfect performance under adversarial conditions and a research agent capable of verifiable, self-critical reasoning.
